### Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
In this project we will use the said Babylon JavaScript engine and we will make a 3D game which can be run on any browser(multi-platform). This game will be using mouse and keyboard keys to move characters around the ground and shoot cannon, laser, and bullets projectile to destroy other meshes(players,enemies). We will also use the socket.io and node express server to run and create multiplayer mode to instantiate multiple player objects. Also, this project will be stored on Heroku.com for hosting online and we will get an online link of cloud storage at Heroku. The main purpose and our goal in this project will be to enhance our understanding to develop complete system to production by using any suitable methodology of system development life cycle (SDLC) i.e. agile, waterfall models.
